# Intermediate-Projects
This project entails the code to download any youtube video and store it in your computer.
The input is the link of the video to be downloaded. 
It runs on command line, so the input must be given only on terminal. 
There will be a message displayed in the terminal when the file is executed - "Enter the URL of the youtube video." followed by a tab.
You can paste the link there !. 


Also, the video will be downloaded in that folder, which you have provided to the output path. 

for example :  video.download(output_path = r"C:\Users\AGASTYA SHANKER\Python Files\Youtube")
